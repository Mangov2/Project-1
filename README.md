Aiden Ferris- Project 1
The lexer is implemented in Python and can be executed on Windows or Unix/Linux. The executable file name is lexer.exe. This project implements a lexical analyzer (lexer) for the RAT25S language. It uses finite state machines (FSMs) to recognize identifiers, integers, and real numbers, while handling keywords, separators, operators.
